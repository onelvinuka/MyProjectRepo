                Given the complexity of mathematical manipulation required for putting all code approaches and design equation into a programmable platform graphical user interface provided in MATLAB 2010a was preferred for the programming. Main advantage of the use of MATLAB 2010a is its ability to tackle symbolic operations. Furthermore, the graphical interface allows the program develop as a a Windows application, which can be conveniently incorporated
